## Why do we build an analytics dashboard?

As Singapore continues its journey towards an open electricity market, one of the key challenges that regulators, suppliers, and retailers face is the effective management of the vast amounts of data generated by the industry. While structured data offers many benefits, including increased efficiency and accuracy in analysis, relying solely on this type of data can be limiting in terms of insights and innovation.

To address this challenge, we have developed this analytics dashboard, a powerful tool that goes beyond structured data to provide a more comprehensive view of Singapore's electricity consumption patterns and trends. Through this app, market players can gain valuable insights that will help them make informed decisions about supply planning and pricing structures, as well as stay ahead of the competition in this dynamic market.
