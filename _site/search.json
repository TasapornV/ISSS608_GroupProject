    "text": "Singapore has progressively moved towards an open electricity market since 2001 to ensure a reliable energy supply and promote effective competition in the energy market.\nHowever, it is challenging to analyze the energy market and make informed decisions due to several variable components that could influence the market. First, the price of electricity in the wholesale market fluctuates depending on the electricity demand and supply, which are dependent on consumption patterns as well as gas industry respectively. About 95% of electricity is generated using natural gas. Next, there are multiple parties (Electricity Market Authority, Power generation companies, Electricity Retailers, etc) involved in the electricity market.\nTo address this challenge, we build this RShinny app to provide relevant stakeholders with means of analyzing and explore the large dataset using applicable analytics models. Also, we want to help the users digest the information about the Singapore energy market easily through visualizations."

The tabs are broadly categorized into 7 sections, namely:\n\nEnergy Supply\nEnergy Transformation\nEnergy Consumption\nEnergy Balances\nEnergy Prices\nSolar\nManpower\n\nFor this project, we will be focusing on electricity and gas consumption, supply and prices."

    "text": "4 Visualization and Analysis\n\n4.1 Overview Dashboard\nTo provide users some basic insights on the Singapore energy market, an Overview tab is built for users to explore the electricity and gas supply, prices and consumption by areas, regions and dwelling types. Changes over time are also visualized to provide users a more comprehensive view.\n\n4.1.1 Main R Packages\n\nggplot2: for descriptive visualization such as boxplots\nggiraph: for interactive visualization\ngeofacet: for visualization laid out according to the geographic topology\ntimetk: for time series visualization\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Proposed Visual Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Clustering Analysis\nClustering analysis is performed to help users identify clusters with different consumption patterns. The clustering analysis is done using the consumption data for each planning area and dwelling type over time. This analysis will help stakeholders in performing future strategic planning activities such as supply planning and pricing.\n\n4.2.1 Main R Packages\n\ndtwclust: for time series clustering\ndendextend: to visualize and compare hierarchical clustering’s dendogram\ntmap: representing clusters on interactive map visual\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Porposed Visual Design\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Inferential Analysis\n\n4.3.1 Analysis\nWhen we have more than two sample groups, we utilize ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to see if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of two or more independent sample groups. In other words, it compares the means of different samples to determine the influence of one or more factors.\nCorrelation plots, also known as correlograms for more than two variables, facilitate the visualization of the correlation between continuous variables.\n\n\n4.3.2 Main R Packages\n\nggplot2: for descriptive visualization such as boxplots\nggbetweenstats: A combination of box and violin plots along with jittered data points for between-subjects designs with statistical details included in the plot as a subtitle\nggcorrplot: Visualize a correlation matrix using ggplot2. It provides a solution for reordering the correlation matrix and displays the significance level on the correlogram. It includes also a function for computing a matrix of correlation p-values.\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Porposed Visual Design\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Forecasting\n\n4.4.1 Analysis\nThe objective of the forecasting visualization is to develop a tool that allows the user to select different data tables via data exploration and display the resulting forecast. Different predictive models would be run and the model accuracy and confidence level would be make available to the users. The best performing model is recommended.\n\n\n4.4.2 Main R Packages\n\nmodeltime: The time series forecasting framework for use with the ‘tidymodels’ ecosystem. Models considered include ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, SARIMA, Long Short-Term Memory and additional time series models from the ‘forecast’, ‘tseries’ and ‘prophet’ packages.\ntidymodels: a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Visual Design\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Data\nA data view is introduced to provide the user with an overview of how the data appears. Users will be able to choose which table and columns to display.\n\n4.5.1 Visual Design"
