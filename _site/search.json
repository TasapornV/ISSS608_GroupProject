Changes over time are also visualized to provide users a more comprehensive view.\n\n4.1.1 Main R Packages & Functions\n\nggplot2: for descriptive visualization such as boxplots\nggiraph/plotly: for interactive visualization\ngeofacet: for visualization laid out according to the geographic topology\ntimetk: for time series visualization\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Application Design\n\n\n\n\n4.2 \n\n\n\n\n4.3 Clustering Analysis\nClustering analysis is performed to help users identify clusters with distinct consumption patterns. The clustering analysis is done using the consumption data for each planning area and dwelling type over time. This analysis will help stakeholders in future strategic planning activities such as supply planning and pricing.\n\n4.3.1 Main R Packages & Functions\n\ndtwclust: for time series clustering\ndendextend: to visualize and compare hierarchical clustering’s dendrogram\ntmap: representing clusters on interactive map visual\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Application Design\nINSERT SCREENSHOT\n\n\n\n4.4 Inferential Analysis\nWhen there are more than two sample groups, ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used to test if there are statistically significant differences between the means of these independent sample groups. In other words, it compares the means of different samples to determine the influence of one or more factors.\n[TBC] Correlation plots, also known as correlograms for more than two variables, facilitate the visualization of the correlation between continuous variables.[TBC]\n\n4.4.1 Main R Packages & Functions\n\nggplot2: for descriptive visualization such as boxplots\nggbetweenstats: A combination of box and violin plots along with jittered data points for between-subjects designs with statistical details included in the plot as a subtitle\nggcorrplot: Visualize a correlation matrix using ggplot2. It provides a solution for reordering the correlation matrix and displays the significance level on the correlogram. It includes also a function for computing a matrix of correlation p-values.\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Application Design\nINSERT SCREENSHOT\n\n\n\n4.5 Time Series Forecasting\nVarious predictive models are built onto the app for users to forecast the future consumption trends. The model accuracy and confidence level are also made available for users.\n\n4.5.1 Main R Packages & Functions\n\nmodeltime: The time series forecasting framework for use with the ‘tidymodels’ ecosystem. Models considered include ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, SARIMA, Long Short-Term Memory and additional time series models from the ‘forecast’, ‘tseries’ and ‘prophet’ packages.\ntidymodels: a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles.\n\n\n\n4.5.2 Application Design\nINSERT SCREENSHOT\n\n\n\n4.6 Data\nA data view is introduced to provide the user with an overview of how the data appears. Users will be able to choose which table and columns to display.\n\n4.6.1 Visual Design"
