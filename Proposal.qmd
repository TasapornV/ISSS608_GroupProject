## Introduction

Singapore has progressively moved towards an open electricity market since 2001 with the objectives to ensure reliable energy supply and promote effective competition in the energy market.

To support these objectives, we build this RShinny app to provide relevant stakeholders with deeper understanding of the Singapore electricity consumption through several analytics models and visualizations.

## Proposed Scope

Our RShinny app allows users to interact with the data to:

1.  Gain an overview of the current electricity market in Singapore,
2.  Cluster planning areas based on similarities in consumption patterns,
3.  Perform inferential statistical analysis, and
4.  Perform time series forecasting.

A detailed description and sketch of the proposed analyses and visualizations are presented in section 4 of this proposal.

## Data

The data used in this project is extracted from Energy Market Authority (EMA) Singapore. It contains data between year 2005 and 2022, with a total of 35 tabs. The tabs are broadly categorized into 7 sections, namely:

1.  Energy Supply
2.  Energy Transformation
3.  Energy Consumption
4.  Energy Balances
5.  Energy Prices
6.  Solar
7.  Manpower

For this project, we will be focusing on electricity consumption, supply and prices.

## Visualization and Analysis

### Overview Dashboard

To provide users some basic insights on the Singapore electricity market, an Overview tab is built for users to explore the electricity supply, prices and consumption by areas, regions and dwelling types. Changes over time are also visualized to provide users a more comprehensive view.

#### Main R Packages

-   **ggplot2:** for descriptive visualization such as boxplots

-   **ggiraph:** for interactive visualization

-   **geofacet:** for visualization laid out according to the geographic topology

-   **timetk:** for time series visualization

#### Proposed Visual Design

### Clustering Analysis

Clustering analysis is performed to help users identify clusters with different consumption patterns. The clustering analysis is done using the consumption data for each planning area and dwelling type over time. This analysis will help stakeholders in performing future strategic planning activities such as supply planning and pricing.

#### Main R Packages

-   **dtwclust:** for time series clustering

-   **dendextend:** to visualize and compare hierarchical clustering's dendogram

-   **tmap:** representing clusters on interactive map visual

### Inferential Analysis

#### Analysis

When we have more than two sample groups, we utilize ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to see if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of two or more independent sample groups. In other words, it compares the means of different samples to determine the influence of one or more factors.

Correlation plots, also known as correlograms for more than two variables, facilitate the visualization of the correlation between continuous variables.

#### Main R Packages

-   **ggplot2:** for descriptive visualization such as boxplots
-   **ggbetweenstats:** A combination of box and violin plots along with jittered data points for between-subjects designs with statistical details included in the plot as a subtitle
-   **ggcorrplot:** Visualize a correlation matrix using ggplot2. It provides a solution for reordering the correlation matrix and displays the significance level on the correlogram. It includes also a function for computing a matrix of correlation p-values.

### Forecasting

#### Analysis

The objective of the forecasting visualization is to develop a tool that allows the user to select different data tables via data exploration and display the resulting forecast.

#### Main R Packages

-   **modeltime:** The time series forecasting framework for use with the 'tidymodels' ecosystem. Models include ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and additional time series models from the 'forecast' and 'prophet' packages.
-   **tidymodels:** a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) principles.

### Data

A data view is introduced to provide the user with an overview of how the data appears. Users will be able to choose which table and columns to display.
