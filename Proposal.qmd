## Introduction

Singapore has progressively moved towards an open electricity market since 2001 with the objectives to ensure reliable energy supply and promote effective competition in the energy market.

To support these objectives, we build this RShinny app to provide relevant stakeholders with deeper understanding of the Singapore electricity consumption through several analytics models and visualizations.

## Proposed Scope

Our RShinny app allows users to interact with the data to:

1.  Gain an overview of the current electricity market in Singapore, in terms of supply, consumption and pricing,
2.  Observe similarities in consumption patterns based on spatio-temporal clustering
3.  Perform inferential statistical analysis, and
4.  Perform time series forecasting.

A detailed description and sketch of the proposed analyses and visualizations are presented in section 4 of this proposal.

## Data

The data used in this project is extracted from Energy Market Authority (EMA) Singapore. It contains data between year 2005 and 2022, with a total of 35 tabs. The tabs are broadly categorized into 7 sections, namely:

1.  Energy Supply
2.  Energy Transformation
3.  Energy Consumption
4.  Energy Balances
5.  Energy Prices
6.  Solar
7.  Manpower
