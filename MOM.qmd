-   This website provides statistics on Singapore energy sector, including the energy supply, consumption and prices. 

-   This might be an interesting area of interest both from the supplier and consumer perspective but a valid and strong use case has to be established.

**Objective**: Reviewing individual ideas from ideation, explore potential spin-off

**Discussion Points**

Explore ways to spin-off current idea and to discuss

1.  **Visualize Singapore transformation for areas of interests**

-   Such as education, wealth of the city, etc.
-   Potential challenges on predictive
-   Advantage: large dataset and multiple areas to explore 

2.  **Low birth rate**

-   Hypothesis: CPI vs Income
-   Potential area
-   Comparison with other countries is also possible (similar traits among with

3.  **Global cost of living**

-   Limited by few input parameters
-   Possible to combine with \'Low birth rate\'
-   Not able to standalone

4.  **Twitter topic analysis**

-   Too challenging to visualize

5.  **Next million dollar HDB**

-   Find factors that might be correlated in driving the HDB price up.
